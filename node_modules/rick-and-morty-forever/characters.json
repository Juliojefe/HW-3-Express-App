    "Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call 'love' is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.",
    "Worse, you're smart. When you know nothing matters, the universe is yours. And I've never met a universe that was into it. The universe is basically an animal, it grazes on the ordinary. It creates infinite idiots, just to eat them, not unlike your friend Timmy.",
    "So, in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy, hysterical bird-brain homunculi. And I honestly can't even tell the two of you apart half the time because I don't go by height or age, I go by amount of pain in my *ss—which makes you both identical. All right, everything resolved? Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world?",
    "Well, I don't like your unemployed genes in my grandchildren, Jerry, but life is made of little concessions.",
    "To live is to risk it all. Otherwise, you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you.",
    "I don't know, maybe you matter so little that I like you. Or maybe it makes you matter. Maybe I love you. Maybe something about your mother. Don't jump a gift shark in the mouth.",
    "There’s pros and cons to every alternate timeline. Fun facts about this one: It’s got giant, telepathic spiders, eleven 9/11s, and the best ice cream in the multiverse!",
    "I’m not looking for judgement, just a yes or no. Can you assimilate a giraffe?",
    "Oh it gets darker Morty…",
    "Morty, you gotta flip ’em off. I told them it means “peace among worlds.” How hilarious is that!",
    "You pass butter.",
    "Alright, Morty, I just gotta erhp combine it with some of your DNA. Morty: Oh well, okay. [unzips] Rick: A hair, Morty. I need one of your hairs. This isn't Game of Thrones.",
    "That's right, Morty! This is gonna be a lot like that, except y'know, it's gonna me-beh... make sense. Morty: Inception made sense! Rick: You don't have to try and impress me, Morty!",
    "Think you could do that Morty? You think anyonne but me could do it ever in a billion years? Do you think if God existed he could do it? The answer is no. If God exists its fucking me!",
    "You ever hear about Wall Street, Morty? Y-Y-Y'know what those guys do i-in-in their fancy boardrooms? They take their balls and they dip 'em in cocaine and wipe 'em all over each other—y'know, Grandpa goes around and he does his business in public, because Grandpa isn't shady.",
    "That's my series arc, Morty! If it takes nine seasons, I want my McNugget... dipping sauce Szechuan sauce, Morty! That's what's gon-it's gonna take us all the way to the end, Morty!",
    "When you’re wearing these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty, up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together.",

    "You're your own person, Stacy.",
    "On one of our adventures, Rick and I basically destroyed the whole world. So we bailed on that reality and we came to this one. Because in this one, the world wasn't destroyed. And in this one, we were dead. So we came here, a-an-an-and we buried ourselves and we took their place. And every morning, Summer, I eat breakfast 20 yards away from my own rotting corpse!",

    "Yeah, It Is. You Know Why, Rick? Because When You're An Ae, It Doesn't Matter How Right You Are, Nobody Wants To Give You The Satisfaction.",
    "Like Father, Like G**n Daughter! You Wanna Be Like Rick?! Congratulations! You're Just As Arrogant And Just As Irresponsible!",
    "This Seems Like A Good Time For A Drink, And A Cold, Calculated Speech With Sinister Overtones. A Speech About Politics, About Order, Brotherhood, Power...But Speeches Are For Campaigning. Now Is The Time For Action.",

    "Rick, when you say you made an exact replica of the house, did you mean, like, an exact replica?",
    "How many of these are just horrible mistakes I made? I mean, maybe I’d stop making so many if I let myself learn from them.",
    "No, no, I haven't seen that. I mean, why would a Pop-Tart want to live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, th-that would be like the scariest place for them to live. Y'know what I mean?",
    "SCREW YOU, RICK! I'LL PURGE YOU TOO, YOU OLD... 'RICKETY' PIECE OF CRAP! THIS HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING! I'M GONNA RIP YOUR FUCKING GUTS OUT AND SMEAR 'EM ALL OVER YOUR FACE! I AIN'T TAKING NO SH-AAAHH!!",

I don't care what you do, you just gotta get it together. [pause] Get your sht together.",
    "This seems like a good time for a drink, and a cold calculated speech with sinister overtones. A speech about politics, about order, brotherhood, power. But speeches are for campaigning.",

    "Bird Person: Morty, do you know what wubba lubba dub dub means? Morty: Oh, that's just Rick's stupid nonsense catchphrase. Bird Person: It's not nonsense at all. In my people's tongue, it means, I am in great pain. Please help me.",
